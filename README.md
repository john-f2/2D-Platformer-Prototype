# 2D-Platformer-Prototype
My 2D Platformer Prototype 

## Purpose and Goals 
Inspired by playing 2D side-scrolling platformers (specifically Momodora)
I wanted to learn more about game development and potentially turn it into a new side programming hobby. I also felt that it was a great way to learn C#.
My ultimate goal is to create a metroidvania style game 
This project will be where I do all my initial learning and prototyping for the game. 


## Installation
In order to run this project, you need to install Unity and an IDE that will let you edit C# code (MonoDevelop for Mac or VisualStudios for Window)
You can then import the project into Unity 


## Built with
• Unity
